# ðŸŽ¥ WatchVault â€“ General Implementation Plan

> This is a first, very general plan of the app, intended for stakeholders to understand the overall concept and workflow.  

## Business Idea
A web app where users can explore movies (from an external API), save them to a personal list, and track watched movies with ratings/reviews.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** .NET 8 Web API  
- **Frontend:** Angular 20  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Containerization:** Docker  

## Authentication (JWT)
- POST /api/auth/register â€“ register new user  
- POST /api/auth/login â€“ login, returns JWT  
- GET /api/auth/me â€“ get current user  

## Backend Models
- User (Id, Username, Email, PasswordHash, PasswordSalt)  
- Movie (Id, ExternalId, Title, Year, PosterUrl, CreatedAt)  
- UserMovie (Id, UserId, MovieId, Status [ToWatch | Watched], WatchedDate, Review, Rating)  

## Movie Endpoints
- GET /api/movies/search?query=xyz â€“ proxy search to external API  
- POST /api/user-movies â€“ add movie to userâ€™s list (status=ToWatch or Watched)  
- GET /api/user-movies â€“ get userâ€™s movies (filter by status)  
- GET /api/user-movies/{id} â€“ get specific user-movie  
- PUT /api/user-movies/{id} â€“ update status/review/rating/watchedDate  
- DELETE /api/user-movies/{id} â€“ remove from userâ€™s list  

## Frontend Views & Components
- Auth: LoginComponent, RegisterComponent  
- Movies: MovieSearchComponent, MovieDetailsComponent  
- User Lists: WatchlistComponent, WatchedListComponent, ReviewFormComponent  
- Shared: NavbarComponent, AuthGuardService  

## Database
- Users (Id, Username, Email, PasswordHash, PasswordSalt)  
- Movies (Id, ExternalId, Title, Year, PosterUrl)  
- UserMovies (Id, UserId, MovieId, Status, WatchedDate, ReviewId)  
- Review (Id, ReviewDate, ReviewText, Rate)  

## App Flow Example
1. User registers and logs in (JWT stored).  
2. Searches for a movie via external API.  
3. Adds it to Watchlist â†’ saved in DB.  
4. Later marks it as Watched â†’ updates status, adds review.  
5. Can browse Watchlist or Watched History.
